This is my MSR seminars theme created from scratch files in Wordpress

Here is a Wordpress seminar website I am currently playing around with learning how they are structured, I have been using working the site to include:

- Creating Custom Posts
- Post listings and filtering by categories
- Creating templates for events, profile posts etc.
- Working on animation for text and images
- Creating CPT for people, podcasts, news/features, partner companies etc.
- Showing panelists, agendas and seminars through various streams.

It is built with Node.js modules and compiled with sass to complie css with webpack and laravel-mix.
